# Netflix-Exploratory-Analysis

As I am currently taking the 'Data Scientist track with Python' in DataCamp, I wanted to do something alongside to put into practice what I have been learning so far and not just stick to the theory.
When I finished the first module, I encountered with the project 'Investigating Movies and Guest Stars in the Office'. I started working on it on my local machine with the Kaggle dataset 'netflix_titles' and tried to answer the question: 'Is there a relation between the release year of movies and their duration?'. Let's see the visual I got as a result of my analysis:

The green dots refer to Comedies.
The blue dots to Documentaries.
The red ones to Children.
And black for all of the others.

We can see that in fact there has been a decrease in the duration of the movies throughout the years. It would be interesting to add countries to the graphic to see in which of them the duration of the movies has decreased the most, and investigate why that could have happened.

As this is my first project, I recognise there is a lot to improve, but I am happy with the result that I got from performing a simple first analysis.

Feedback is welcome! :)

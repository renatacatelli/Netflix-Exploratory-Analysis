# Netflix-Exploratory-Analysis

As I am currently taking the 'Data Scientist track with Python' in DataCamp, I wanted to do something alongside to put into practice what I have been learning so far and not just stick to the theory.
When I finished the first module, I encountered with the project 'Investigating Movies and Guest Stars in the Office'. I started working on it on my local machine with the Kaggle dataset 'netflix_titles' and tried to answer the question: 'Is there a relation between the release year of movies and their duration?'. Let's see the visual I got as a result of my analysis:
